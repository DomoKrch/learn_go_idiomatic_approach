# Learning Golang: Idiomatic Approach

This repo is dedicated to Golang experiments for the sake of learning the surface of the language

## Ch1

Just setting up the environments and learning some neat go commands for keeping your code clean

## Ch2

Useful information about types, type ranges and conversion between them, different methods of variable declarations and its behaviours. Also, a little bit about naming conventions

## Ch3

Mostly explanations about composite types, like slices, arrays, maps and structs. Big emphasis on various methods for their initialization, when to use them, helpful functions for them and possible mechanics of these types that may count as something not-so-obvious when working with them. Some information on the strings, their relation to bytes and how a group of bytes may form a whole code point which can be interpreted as rune (mostly in UTF-8)
